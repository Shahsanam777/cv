## My Projects

These are course projects from my studies at SITE 1101. Each project helped me develop practical skills in design, teamwork, and problem-solving.

### Project 1: How Does Hardware Work?

  title="How does hardware work?"
  description="As a member of Team 49, I worked together with my teammates to build and test three basic logic gates — OR, AND, and NOR — using transistors and other components from the kit box. Through teamwork and hands-on experience, we also created additional bonus gates such as NAND and an extra NOR gate. This project helped me better understand how electronic circuits work and made the learning process more engaging and meaningful."

### Project 2: Hour of Code

{% include project-card.html
  title="Hour of Code"
  description="For this project, my team and I developed our understanding of algorithms and shared our knowledge with our community. We worked in a team of 4 students and chose a team leader before we started. As part of the Hour of Code campaign, called Hour of AI in 2025, we visited School 238 to run our coding event. We prepared beforehand on how to teach in an engaging and beneficial way. We used Microsoft MakeCode and teaching materials to guide our session, which helped students learn basic programming concepts while having fun."
