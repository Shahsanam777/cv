## My Projects

These are course projects from my studies at SITE 1101. Each project helped me develop practical skills in design, teamwork, and problem-solving.

### Project 1: How Does Hardware Work?

**What I learned:**
- How transistors work and combine to form logic gates
- Testing and troubleshooting electronic circuits
- Working with hardware components and kits
- Teamwork and hands-on problem-solving

### Project 2: Hour of Code

{% include project-card.html
  title="Hour of Code"
  description="For this project, my team and I developed our understanding of algorithms and shared our knowledge with our community. We worked in a team of 4 students and chose a team leader before we started. As part of the Hour of Code campaign, called Hour of AI in 2025, we visited School 238 to run our coding event. We prepared beforehand on how to teach in an engaging and beneficial way. We used Microsoft MakeCode and teaching materials to guide our session, which helped students learn basic programming concepts while having fun."

**What we accomplished:**
- Developed and led a coding workshop for younger students
- Used Microsoft MakeCode to teach programming concepts
- Practiced teamwork and leadership in a real-world teaching scenario
- Shared knowledge of algorithms and basic programming
- Made learning fun and engaging for students
